Convert the following screenshot to a JSON file that looks like this: 
```
{ "snippets": [
    {type: "text", value: "Some text in Markdown"},
    {type: "section_title", value: "Some section title"}, 
    ... (more snippets) 
]}
```
Each snippet in the array has a type and a value (Markdown notation containing formulas in LaTeX notation as $...$). The types of snippets are the following:
(1) "title" - the title of the document.
(2) "subtitle" - the subtitle (if there is some text right under the title), 
(3) "text" - some other text (not highlighted in any way), 
(4) "example" - some introductory or otherwise easy question. 
(5) "theorem" - a highlighted mathematical statement (lemma, theorem, other statement), 
(6) "proof" - the proof or some justification for the statement right above
(7) "section_title" - a title for some subsection, 
(8) "problem" - a formulation of some problem, 
(9) "solution" - a solution for some problem (usually the one right above this). 
(10) "annotation" - some description of what material is about to follow (usually in italics).

Please enclose the resulting JSON between three opening and three closing backquotes.
