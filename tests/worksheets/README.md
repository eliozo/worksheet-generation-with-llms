Convert the above screenshot to the following JSON array: 
```
{ "snippets": [
    { "type": "...", "value": "..." },
    { "type": "...", "value": "..." },
    ...
]}
```
It contains values - Markdown snippets containing formulas in LaTeX notation as $...$.
Each value corresponds to one text paragraph in the original document (sometimes containing 
page-wide formulas enclosed between $$ and $$.) Images, if present in the document, 
do not need to be converted to values.
Use the following snippet types:
(1) "title" - the title of the document.
(2) "subtitle" - the subtitle (if there is some text right under the title), 
(3) "text" - some other text (not highlighted in any way), 
(4) "example" - some introductory or otherwise easy question. 
(5) "theorem" - a highlighted mathematical statement (lemma, theorem, other statement), 
(6) "proof" - the proof or some justification for the statement right above
(7) "section_title" - a title for some subsection, 
(8) "problem" - a formulation of some problem, 
(9) "solution" - a solution for some problem (usually the one right above this). 
(10) "annotation" - some description of what material is about to follow (usually in italics).

Please do not omit or alter the text in any way, just separate it into snippets. 
Return your answer with three opening backquotes and three closing backquotes.
